# MeatBagPnP
The year is 2040. The robot uprising is complete, and most humans are enslaved for their purposes. This tool is written to provide an easy tool for the robot overlords to now use humans as a pick-n-place machine. It's rumored that by contributing to this repo you will be given a task involving less poisonous materials.

To use: scan barcode on a part bag, and utility tells you where to place part on PCB. Helps you (the meatbag) become a pick-n-place.

## Installing

The tool runs on Python 2.7.

### Dependencies

Yes

### Scanner Setup

The tool is designed to run with a crappy barcode scanner. It probably works with a good barcode scanner, but I don't have one.

It automatically collects keystrokes while the window has focus.
