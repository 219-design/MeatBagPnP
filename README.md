# MeatBagPnP
The year is 2040. The robot uprising is complete, and most humans are enslaved for their purposes. This tool is written to provide an easy tool for the robot overlords to now use humans as a pick-n-place machine.

To use: scan barcode on a part bag, and utility tells you where to place part on PCB. Helps you (the meatbag) become a pick-n-place.
